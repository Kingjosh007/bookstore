# Bookstore

> In terms of functionality, this project is similar to [Awesome Books](https://github.com/Kingjosh007/awesome-books) that I previously created with Vanilla JS: the user can view a list of books, add or delete a book.

> For the UI, I was inspired by [this Zeplin project](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5b35a9e13227086040f8eb75/screen/5b695e29bb8c844f118f9378).


By building this app, I learned how to use React & Redux (and even connect them to an API). 
The project was divided into four (4) milestones. That in bold is what I'm working on:

- Milestone 1: Initialize project with components
- **Milestone 2: Create and remove a book**
- Milestone 3: Connect to API
- Milestone 4: Style the app


## Live Demo

This project is not deployed yet. It will be deployed later to **Github Pages**, **Heroku** and **Netlify**.
